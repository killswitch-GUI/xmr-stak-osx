/*
 * Thread configuration for each thread. Make sure it matches the number above.
 * low_power_mode - This mode will double the cache usage, and double the single thread performance. It will 
 *                  consume much less power (as less cores are working), but will max out at around 80-85% of 
 *                  the maximum performance.
 *
 * no_prefetch -    Some sytems can gain up to extra 5% here, but sometimes it will have no difference or make
 *                  things slower.
 *
 * affine_to_cpu -  This can be either false (no affinity), or the CPU core number. Note that on hyperthreading 
 *                  systems it is better to assign threads to physical cores. On Windows this usually means selecting 
 *                  even or odd numbered cpu numbers. For Linux it will be usually the lower CPU numbers, so for a 4 
 *                  physical core CPU you should select cpu numbers 0-3.
 *
 * On the first run the miner will look at your system and suggest a basic configuration that will work,
 * you can try to tweak it from there to get the best performance.
 * 
 * A filled out configuration should look like this:
 * "cpu_threads_conf" :
 * [ 
 *      { "low_power_mode" : false, "no_prefetch" : true, "affine_to_cpu" : 0 },
 *      { "low_power_mode" : false, "no_prefetch" : true, "affine_to_cpu" : 1 },
 * ],
